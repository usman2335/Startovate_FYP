Each chapter of this book explicitly\ndiscuss every component distinctively. In chapter 1, the concept of LCI and its structure\nis discussed. From chapter 2 to chapter 12, every component is discussed in detail,\ndiscussing about how this component can help in reaching the expected stage of the\nresearch proposal with the supportive example.\nThe LCI and its training guide is designed keeping in mind that technologies to be\ndeveloped must solve the real-world problems, must have feedback received from\nstakeholders, must be patentable, must be viable for market, must offer the technology\nreadiness level and must be seen as a finished products, processes or services. Having\nall these parameters considered by academic inventors and entrepreneurs can save a lot\nof time, effort, and grants to be wasted on inventions which may not be ready to pass\nthrough the process of invention to innovation for commercialization at the technology\ntransfer office.\nThe duration of nine months at University of Utah enabled me to test the LCI and\nits training guide with the postgraduate students and faculty members who were at the\npoint of starting their research process. I got chance to teach Master students of the\nUSAID project for water and sanitation related technologies, Master and PhD students of\nElectrical and Civil Engineering department at University of Uta",

This component\nis associated with the WHAT question of the LCI. Here the purpose is to guide the\nresearchers and academic inventors to look for a real-world problem (Okuda, Runco, &\nBerger, 1991) that needs a solution through technological inventions. Most of the\nseasoned academic inventors usually gain the knowledge of real-world problems through\nthe academically published research articles. These articles guide in the process of\nfinding a research gap which then academic inventors try to fill with advancing their\nknowledge and technology-based inventions. However, an academic inventor may\nendure from disconnect between the real-world problems and the academically published\narticles at the time of exploration of research gap. Most of the work published in the\nacademic journals is more than a year old and therefore enhance the chance of missing-\nout the existing situation in society (Gray, 2021). At that moment, if academic inventors\ninitiate to look for the existing real-world problems, their inventions will have more chance\nof acceptance in the society for solving those problems. The first component of the LCI,\ntherefore, guides the researchers and the academic inventors in a search process of the\nreal-world problems and their depiction in a form of the research gaps.\n20\n\nThe Problem Identification component instigate researchers and academic\ninventors t",

Discussions on whether proposed invention claims for similarities\nwith other inventors’ work or offers a critique that led to the novelty\nfeature(s).\nThe question illustrated above and three items of the LCI Checklist – V need\nsystematized approach to be adopted by the academic inventors and entrepreneurs for\nassociating novelty features to the perceived value (Ulaga & Chacour, 2001). Literature\nproves a connection between the Maslow’s hierarchy of needs (McLeod, 2007) and a\nvalue that end-users perceive through inventions. An article published by Harvard\nBusiness Review (2016) proposes 30 universal elements of value. According to Bain &\nCompany, these 30 elements (Almquist, Senior & Bloch 2016) represent the building\nblocks of value which guides companies in delivering to customers what they want in new\nproducts and services. These 30 elements are classified in four clusters to address the\nconsumers' Functional, Emotional, Life Changing and Social Impact needs. These\nneeds are guided by the theory of human motivation, the Maslow hierarchy of needs,\noffered by Russian American Abraham Maslow (1943) and can create opportunities for\nacademic inventors and entrepreneurs to conceive for inve",

The two hands-on activities proposed in this\nchapter synthesized the entire information and judged the MVRq through the FINER\ncriteria.\nCONCLUSION\nOverall, this chapter presents the LCI Component – VI, supported by the LCI Checklist\n– VI, and the LCI Template – XII: Synthesis Matrix and LCI Template – XIII: MVRq\nElements to derive the Most Valuable Research question (MVRq). The process for\nadopting these templates is clearly given in figure 7.3. In addition, the Picture 7.1 shows\nglimpse of activities carried out with LCI during the researchers’ training.\nIn the next chapter the LCI process will be elaborated further through the LCI\nComponent – VII to learn different Research Methodology techniques in order to develop\nsolutions of the problems identified and synthesized so far.\n85\n\nREFERENCES\n• Biggs, M.

The book is not aimed at developing basic\nresearch which is focused upon extending our understanding of the science governing\nthe nature of our universe (so called blue skies research).\n134\n\nFigure 13.2.
